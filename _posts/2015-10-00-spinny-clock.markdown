You can read the time by finding the most front-facing red flag. The above gif was taken just before two in the morning.

This was a passion project for me where I wanted to design a new kind of clock. Using Solidworks' powerful equation manager, I __designed my own involute gears in a planetary configuration__. This allows the viewer to spin the clock in an attempt to change the time (by moving the most front-facing red flag), but due to the gearing, no amount of spinning actually changes the displayed time. The only thing that can move the clock forward is the ominous click of a stepper motor that ticks like a traditional clock.

I fabricated all the components on this piece using a laser-cutter and a lathe.
