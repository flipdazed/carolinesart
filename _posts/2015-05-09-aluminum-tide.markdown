CNC-barrel cam, laser-cut acrylic, turned brass, milled aluminum, and routed plywood make up this project for a class called mechanical prototyping. Over the course of a month, my team and I fabricated and assembled this piece which is still on the third floor of the academic center of Olin College ready to spin those two ball bearings into mutual orbit to the amusement of students, teachers, and tours.
